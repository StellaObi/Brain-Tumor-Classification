# Brain-Tumor-Classification
This repository contains the codes and resources for my MSc Thesis on "Feature engineering in Brain Tumor MRI Image Classification"
The main objective of this project is to develop a system for diagnosing and classifying brain tumor MRI images, as well as to learn how various image preprocessing and feature techniques can help improve the accuracy of medical image analysis systems.
The project aims to contribute to medical image analysis and aid in early and accurate tumor diagnosis.
